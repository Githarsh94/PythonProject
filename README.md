# PythonProject
This is the project i made in python when i had python as a subject.

If you want to run this code, you need to login to firebase and obtain the keys necessary. put all those into the a file named "keys.json".

The GUI.py file was my attempt at making a GUI for this encryption and decryption tool using tkinter, but it hasn't progressed further. I will do it in the future probably.
